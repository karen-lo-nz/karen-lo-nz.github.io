                            <p>I am an eager learner having been idle for a while in the last couple of years in my job.
                            Coming from a small work environment and having older workmates, I am not as exposed to new or modern systems and software so might be abit slow on uptake. 
                        It's an inside joke with my friends, that I am somehow IT support at work when really I am not that savvy! It's only because I work with slightly older people....</p>

                            <p> Having limited experience working in large group settings, I would like to see how I fit and work in a team environment. I recall enjoying doing group work in uni but that is a about 10 years ago
                            so would be keen to explore the team work dynamics.

                            <p> I have found myself going down a rabbit hole during certain points already, I really need to be more disciplined and ok with the "learning just enough" 
                                and able to stop and clear my mind before approaching something again, if all fails -  ask for help! Being organise in time management and allowing down-time will help too.

                            <p> Just 5 minutes out to clear my mind i.e breathing exercise/ yoga. Speak to someone - coursemates, facilitator etc.

                            <p> There are various channels available i.e the slack channel, course mates and facilitators.</p>

                            <p> Sometimes I am not aware when I am doing something not right/ going down the rabbit hole ie. you dont know what you dont know exist.
                            My learning experience so far has been quite traditional - I am quite happily absorbing things. The self learning approach and writing and elaborating (like this blog) is new so uptake might be slower.

                            <p> While I am still fully-employed, I have full flexibility to focus on the course. Sometimes I might be running some errands for work - late to reply but never too long!
                                Prior commitments include hospital appointments but will advice in advance.
