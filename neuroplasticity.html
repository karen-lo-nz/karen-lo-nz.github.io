                        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                            <p>
                                Great news! The brain is not set, you can teach old dogs new tricks!
                                Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of our brain cells (neurons) to rewire and learn 
                                new things based on our experience and environment. The more we are exposed to certain things
                                our brain cells and its pathways can change, adapt and grow to understand things we never had before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this means that while coding is something new to me, by exposing and training my brain to coding
                                and how it works, in time, anyone can code including me. Believing that this approach does work will 
                                benefit me in this learning process and any other new or foreign things (like motherhood!), that hey don't fret when you don't get 
                                it the first time, you will in time.
                            </p>

                                Neuroplasticity allows for growth. It means that we, as a person can overtime change and grow rather than just set in a static state in our skillset, 
                                intelligence and abilities.

                                    "A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which 
                                    we can’t change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, 
                                    an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and 
                                    avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled. 
                                    A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence 
                                    but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Out of these two mindsets, 
                                    which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior, our relationship with success and 
                                    failure in both professional and personal contexts, and ultimately our capacity for happiness."

                                If something is completely new, it would feel like it is speaking in a different language, give it another shot, 
                                read again, and see if I can understand it with a different explanation, that makes sense to me and gives me context.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Believe that if I don't get it, that's not how it will always be or end of a journey. Rather focus on the process and know that eventually I will get there. Know that 
                                is not because I dont get it but I just haven't got it yet. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               And finally - small wins repeated overtime can lead to a growth mindset! So tackle things in smaller bits and if I need to, repeat those wins.
