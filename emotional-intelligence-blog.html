                                higher levels of collaboration and productivity. In a school environment, this are what institutions want students to gain
                                in what they would all soft-skills i.e leadership, communication, collaboration which comes from either experiencing it
                                or cultivating it by participating. There is no one right or wrong way to do it, but its a matter of growing that humane
                                soft skills.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Intellectual Quotient (IQ)</h2>
                            <p>Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of what people know and how quickly they can solve problems using reasoning.
                                But IQ tests alone don’t necessarily account for the full range of your thinking abilities. 
                                Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Similar to what you will learn in a school environment, the 
                                different subjects, theories and problem solving with a more clear cut approach.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IQ represents abilities such as:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="ul-text">

                               <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                               <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
                               <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
                           </ul>

                             
                            <h2>Why is EQ important</h2>
                            <p> The concept of EQ is relevant to the very core of being human - how we want to look after ourselves and others around us. 
                            Being aware and needs of a person either ownself or others will make life alot easier because the things that upsets and conflicts,
                            are identified, resolved in a considerate and results in beneficial outcomes to all. It results in a "optimal" state of well-being
                            i.e happiness, content, satisfy and peaceful.
