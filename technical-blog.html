                    <p> INLINE - making things...inline, side by side, next to each other. 
                        This function helps us display items side by side. If you are familiar with Microsoft word it is 
                        basically similar to the text wrapping function.</p>

                    <p>We use the css property display to call out this different values i,e </p>
                    <ul class="ul-text">
                        <li>Display: inline;</li>
                        <li>Display: inline-block;</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12">

                    <h2>Display: Inline</h2>
                    <p>Puts two elements side-by-side. Height and width of the element is not adjustable.</p>
                    <p class="inline">inline</p>
                    <p class="inline">inline</p>
                   
                    
                    <h2>Display: Inline-block</h2>
                    <p>Puts two elements side-by-side but you will be able to adjust the height and width</p>
                    </p>
                    <p class="inline-block1">inline-block</p>
                    <p class="inline-block2">inline-block</p>

                    <h2> Non-dev Terms ( I found this online and thought it was helpful to understand)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Imagine if you're attending a concert, you have rows of seats, right. If you assign your friend with an inline seat, they will sit next to you. So the thing with inline seats, it's that they all are the same physical chair.You can't manipulate the chair to make it larger or smaller. One size fits all they call it!

Now your friend Jennifer wants to join you, but because she is the daughter of the owner of the stadium. She gets assigned an inline-block seat. Well, she still gets to sit next to you. Cause she's "inline" with you (bad pun, lol ðŸ˜‚) and of course you want her to sit next to you. However, because she is the daughter of the stadium, her mom wants to make sure she's comfortable. So she gives her a special seat, where her chair is customized and can be adjusted to make it bigger or smaller. Nepotism at its finest ðŸ¤«

Your classmate Angelina is also attending the concert. Now your friend Jennifer doesn't really like her. So she tells her mom to assign her a block seat. That way Angelina is not seated next to you. Instead she sits in the next row.

                    <h2> What is it good for?</h2>
           <p> Example I can think of:
                <ul class="ul-text">
                    <li>creating the pages buttons/ navigation menu on the top of your webpage to put them in one line.</li>
                    <li>Displaying images side by side</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
