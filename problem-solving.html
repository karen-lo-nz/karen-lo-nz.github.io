                        <h2>A simple problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            I have been having problems using the correct ( { ) or ( , ) or ( ; ) after each code, there were several times running the for 
                            function that I had incorrectly used ( , ) rather than ( ; ) 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            It was confusing me why it didnt work and I went through the code line by line, repeating to myself 
                            (similar to the rubber ducky approach).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            It was pretty frustrating. Until I realised that the console message sometimes actually tells me what is wrong!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I learn to read error messages on the console, and also sometimes looking out for simple errors 
                            and not always assuming that it was something major.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Elegant Problem Solving</h2>
                        
                        <p>
                            I am not sure how elegant this is. The Scooby challenge stumped me, there were objects in arrays. 
                            I didnt even know how to start so I looked at the answer for a hint, however while it was great to see that the answer worked, 
                            I didnt understand how it worked.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            So I used the answer as a prompt to help me breakdown the task.  
                            I tried to visualise it by actually arranging out the objects and array. 
                            I also console log out each code when I had written it to see what is happening. 
                            Then I comment it out so that I dont lose it. And kept console logging each line.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            While it was time consuming (rather than elegant), using the tools that were mentioned and 
                            having it worked felt really good! I realised that for me to really learn, I really needed lots of 
                            step by step explanations. I am hopeful in time that things will be easier to grasp so that I can write cleaner code 
                            but for now, it is better with lots of explanations so that I can always refer back to it and understand.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pseudocode seemed to work best for me to understand a task and helped to breakdown daunting tasks.
                            For every task, there needs to be a plan and pseudocode outlines the plan of attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It always helps to try something new but also to be wary that one can fall down a rabbit hole trying something, 
                            then trying to fix something only to discover that what they are asking for was completely different!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rubber ducky method - I find myself talking to myself alot lately and it really works!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are a few error messages that were easy to understand however some were not. 
                            I am sure in time we will be able to understand more of the messages as we become exposed to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Console.logging was very helpful for me to make sure the code is doing what I intended for the code to do or on the contrary
                            what was the code doing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Googling was a great source (like a prompt to give you a headstart) to write the code. 
                            The best thing is that there are multiple sources out there, if one explanation confuses you (i.e for me the too wordy ones) 
                            then there are always other sources. 
                        </p>

                            Asking your peers for help - I havent had the chance to do this much,  I am also abit behind so was great that there are 
                            questions already asked on the slack channel that helps the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Asking coaches for help - I havenâ€™t done much of this but had sought help at the start. 
                            I am also quite fortunate that my partner is a software developer, so without having to wait to ask the questions of my coaches I was able to get it through him quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Improving your process with reflection - Once the problem was solved, I found it helpful to run over my pseudocode again 
                            to rewrite and explain the issue and task better.
                        </p>
